Extract current highlight definitions, and generate your own new colorscheme.\
_"But the colorscheme is not well tuned for startup" is
now **no longer a reason** to give it up!\
~~Why don't you buy a higher-end PC?~~
Happy coding!!!_

## ✨ Features

First off, `ex-colors` is only **a colorscheme generator**;
this plugin itself does **NOT** contain any `ex-`colorschemes.
Please generate your own with [`:ExColors`](#excolors) by yourself.

With executing a single command [`:ExColors`](#excolors) in Command-line mode,

- **Filter off** unnecessary highlight definitions for your use of nvim.\
  _(Our colorscheme owners mercifully support
  a number of plugin-specific highlight groups.
  Although We appreciate the efforts for the maintenance,
  more than half of the definitions are just overheads for individual users.)_
- **Relink** the `link`ed highlight groups in the output,
  and help **omit** redundant ones.\
  For example, outputs can _redirect_ any definitions linked to the previous
  `hl-TSMethod` to `hl-@function.method`,
  and will _not define_ `TSMethod`
  in the output in favor of `@function.method`.
- **Embed** your local adjustments for highlights into `ex-`colorscheme
  **_without performance overheads_.**

And more!
Please check out the available options in [Setup](#%EF%B8%8F-setup) section.
Also see [FAQ](#-faq) at first if you are missing some options.

**NOTE:** _A sane default is already provided._

## ✔️ Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10.4

and no other dependencies.

The outputs are completely independent
from `ex-colors` and the original colorschemes,
which are only required in executing `:ExColors`.

## 📦 Installation

With [lazy.nvim][],

```lua
{
    "aileot/ex-colors.nvim",
    lazy = true,
    cmd = "ExColors",
    ---@type ExColors.Config
    opts = {},
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 👣 Steps

1. Put `vim.cmd("colorscheme foobar")` in your init.lua.
2. Restart nvim to refresh highlight definitions.
3. Load `require("ex-colors").setup()`.
   See [Setup](#%EF%B8%8F-setup) section for the details.
4. Run `:ExColors` in Command-line mode.
   See [:ExColors](#excolors) section for the details.
5. Confirm the output with `:write` or `:update`.
6. Insert `ex-` to your colorscheme name: `vim.cmd("colorscheme ex-foobar")`
7. Done!

### ⚙️ Setup

Change option values via `require("ex-colors").setup()`.\
Please see
[Setup Example with Sane Default Settings](#-setup-example-with-sane-default-settings)
and
[Recommended Settings](#-recommended-settings)
for the details.

#### 🎨 Presets

Some sensible presets are provided.
Please follow the links to the preset modules:

- The [recommended](./lua/ex-colors/presets/init.lua) presets
- The [hlgroup](./lua/ex-colors/presets/hlgroup.lua) presets
- The [parttern](./lua/ex-colors/presets/pattern.lua) presets
- The [relinker](./lua/ex-colors/presets/relinker.lua) presets

You can import them like `require("ex-colors.presets").recommended`.

**NOTE:**
The defined presets including `recommended` can be easily extended with `+`
operator.
For example,

```lua
require("ex-colors.presets").recommended.included_patterns + { "Foo", "Bar" }
```

### 💪 Commands

#### :ExColors[!]

Generate a new colorscheme to the directory
set in `colors_dir` option,
and start `:edit`ing the output file for preview.

The name will be determined as the current value of `g:colors_name` prefixed
by _ex-_, e.g., _ex-habamax_ for _habamax_.

With `!` appended,
it will dump all the highlight definitions to the file
`ex-{g:colors_name}.lua` (not saved),
ignoring all the filter and modifier options.
It is useful to know what you can get primarily,
and, once committed in git, to know
(not necessarily but with some git integration plugins like
[vim-fugitive][],
[gitsigns.nvim][],
etc.)
what definitions are filtered off, or converted.

Please note that some colorscheme plugins provide multiple flavors sharing
a single `g:colors_name`:

1. Given a colorscheme plugin _foobar.nvim_ which provides 3 flavors
   (_foobar-dark_,
   _foobar-light_,
   _foobar-dimmed_),
   but `g:colors_name` is set to `"foobar"` each.
2. Execute `:colorscheme foobar-dark` anyhow in your vimrc.
3. Execute `:ExColors` in Command-line mode.
4. Then, the new colorscheme name generated by `ex-colors` could be
   not _ex-foobar-dark_,
   but _ex-foobar_.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q. Is it considered misappropriating this plugin to create standalone `ex-foobar`repositories?

**A.** Not at all.
You can create hard forks of your favorite colorschemes
with this plugin -- you don't need _my_ permissions;
however, the forks **could** be misappropriating the original colorscheme
of _the authors and maintainers_.
Remember to pay due respects to their efforts.
The credits would go to them.\
<small>
(And it would simply a mess that GitHub is flooded with `ex-this` and `ex-that`.)
</small>

### Q. Why don't you support byte-compile?

**A.** Since I'd once attempted byte-compile
but `vim.loader` did not seem to care about it:
no performance changes, or negligible.
Leave it to `vim.loader`.

### Q. Why don't you support this colorscheme or that colorscheme?

**A.** `ex-colors` supports any colorschemes by nature.
Please note that this plugin is only **a colorscheme generator**,
and **NOT** contains any colorscheme in this repository itself.
If you find `ex-colors` lacking for some reasonable, internal definitions in
the [`presets`](#-presets) with the default settings,
feel free to [open issue](https://github.com/aileot/ex-colors.nvim/issues)!

### Q. Are there any other dependencies?

**A.** No external dependencies to execute `:ExColors`,
and outputs are independent from the plugin.
Just care about your neovim version.
The relevant Fennel files have already been compiled to Lua in the repository.

### Q. Is it worth applying `:ExColors` to colorschemes which support `cache` option?

<details>
<summary><b>A.</b> TL;DR, yes. (Please click this line for the details.)</summary>

#### Details

AFAIK, what their cache options do is
dumping to their highlight definitions and some relevant tasks
into a binary file for Lua.

The reason of saving their caches in binary is
not only that binary can cut down the load time,
but also that binary is,
by the nature of Lua, the as-is format of a dump from memory.

If you enable `vim.loader`,
your nvim will not load the binary cache directly,
but instead load the cache additionally created by `vim.loader`.
In other words,
it does not so matter whether Lua cache is saved in binary or not,
with `vim.loader` enabled.

And, as far as the cache is loaded apart from `colors/` directory,
nvim will take extra times to load a colorscheme: a file in `colors/`,
some plugin's Lua modules to load the cached module,
and the binary cache itself.

It should be well known that it takes a time to find and load additional files.
(I assume the bottleneck is IO...)

Since your `ex-`colorscheme is generated into a single file,
and `vim.loader` is responsible for handling binary cache,
the original one could not be faster both theoretically and practically
than `ex-`one.

</details>

### Q. Can we get a dump of all the available highlight definitions without any filters?

**A.** Execute `:ExColors!` in Command-line mode.
Make sure that `!` is appended.
See [:ExColors](#excolors) for the details.

### Q. Why don't you add option to resolve `link`ed highlight groups, dropping internal highlight definitions like `hl-RedBold`?

**A.** As once tested,
it seems to be slower to define every highlight groups each with resolved `fg`, `bg`, `italic`, and so on.

### Q. Some highlights are oddly applied when when I load `ex-`colorscheme after loading another in an nvim session

**A.** Please enable `clear_highlight` and `reset_syntax` options as your needs.
See [Setup Example with Sane Default Settings](#-setup-example-with-sane-default-settings)
for the details.
The options are disabled by default for the runtime performance reasons.
